Flask Web App with MySQL and Password Encryption

A simple web application built with Flask, showcasing user authentication with MySQL for database connection and SHA256 for password encryption. 
This project provides a foundation for building Flask applications and demonstrates concepts like:

    User login/logout with session management
    Database operations using MySQL
    Basic password encryption with SHA256
    Role-based access to protected pages

Features

    User Authentication: Secure login/logout functionality with password encryption.
    Session Management: Persistent sessions to manage user state.
    MySQL Integration: CRUD operations with a MySQL database.
    Flask Decorators: Used to restrict access to protected pages.
    
Usage

    Register a new user to access the dashboard.
    Protected pages will redirect to the login page if the user is not authenticated.

Motivation

This project was inspired by a YouTube tutorial to get hands-on experience with Flask, MySQL, and password encryption. 
Having worked with Java, Spring, and MySQL, this was an excellent opportunity to explore similar concepts with Python.

Key Takeaways

    Flask: Lightweight framework for building web applications in Python.
    MySQL Integration: Direct database interaction with Flask.
    Password Encryption: SHA256 for securely storing passwords.
    Session Handling: Managing user states with Flask sessions.
